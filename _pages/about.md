Unlike English, there didn't seem to be a easily discoverable collection of definitive, open source Irish language datasets for NLP research.

nlp.Irish hopes to address that by cataloguing the open source datasets available today

All of the information on this site is open source and is hosted at [https://github.com/nlp-irish/nlp.irish](https://github.com/nlp-irish/nlp.irish)
